## üìò Introduction

<small>[Return to Top](#contents)</small>

This is a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) written in R that uses the simmer package. The code is designed to simulate the flow of battlefield casualties in Large Scale Combat Operations (LSCO) scenarios. The purpose of the simulation is to support decision making on deployed health system design with a focus on capacity planning.

DES has been used as a proven way to simulate healthcare systems and support healthcare decision-making (as shown in [[9]](#References)).

## üåç Context

<small>[Return to Top](#contents)</small>

The code simulates a deployed combat brigade based on the Australian combat and health brigade capabilities.

**Organisation**. The simulation is built around the following design:

1. The combat brigade has formed `3` battlegroups headquartered by the resident `2` infantry battalions and `1` cavalry regiment. a commander's reserve has been established by the brigade commander formed around a combat team. The cavalry regiment based battlegroup is performing a screen forward of the two infantry battlegroups. Each battlegroup has been force assigned `2` treatment teams to provide close health support.

2. Artillery support is assigned with battery's assigned Direct Support (DS) to the infantry battlegroups and are placed with the capacity to provide support to their supported call-signs. The Brigade Headquarters (HQ) has established a HQ-Forward and HQ-Main. The HQ-Forward is placed one tactical bound behind the forward battlegroups. `1` additional treatment team has been establsihed to provide close health support to the artillery unit and HQ-Forward. `1` Role 2 - Basic (R2B) has been established in vicinity of the HQ-Forward to support damage control (DAMCON) and stabilise casualties prior to evacuation to higher level care.

3. The Combat Service Support Battalion (CSSB) has established the Brigade Maintenance Area (BMA). One further treatment team has been established to provide close health support within the BMA. To provide surgical capability to the brigade `1` Role 2 - Enhanced Heavy (R2E Heavy) hospital has been established within the BMA.

### üè•Health Teams

#### Role 1 (R1) Treatment Team

A role 1 treatment team provides the first line of medical care. It is designed to deliver immediate lifesaving measures, perform triage and stabilization, and manage minor injuries and illnesses close to the point of injury or unit location. These teams also prepare casualties for evacuation to higher levels of care if needed.

#### Role 2 Basic (R2B)

A Role 2 Basic (R2B) medical treatment facility provides forward surgical and resuscitative care close to the battlefield. Its purpose is to deliver damage-control surgery, critical care, and short-term patient holding in austere environments where rapid intervention can save lives.

It‚Äôs designed to be mobile, logistically lean, and capable of stabilizing casualties before evacuation to higher-level care. With ICU beds, low-dependency holding, and a surgical team, R2B bridges the gap between frontline treatment and more comprehensive facilities like Role 2 Enhanced or Role 3.

#### Role 2 Enhanced Heavy (R2E Heavy)

A R2E Heavy facility delivers advanced surgical and critical care capabilities in forward-deployed military operations. Its purpose is to provide damage-control surgery, intensive care, inpatient services, and scalable resuscitation for casualties who require more than basic stabilization but are not yet ready for strategic evacuation.

The R2E Heavy is a static field hospital with designed to handle complex trauma, prolonged care, and high casualty volumes‚Äîbridging the gap between battlefield stabilization and full hospital-level treatment.

### üõèÔ∏è Bed Types

#### Operating Theatre (OT)

OT beds are specialized surgical stations designed to support damage-control surgery and life-saving interventions. These beds are part of a sterile operating suite and are equipped to handle:

- Emergency trauma procedures.
- Advanced surgical care including orthopedic, abdominal, and thoracic operations.
- Integrated anesthesia and monitoring systems for patient stability.
- Rapid turnover and sterilization protocols to manage high casualty volumes.

#### Resuscitation (Resus) (alternatively Emergency)

Emergency beds are designed for rapid stabilization and life-saving interventions immediately after casualty arrival. These beds support:

- Advanced trauma management including airway control, hemorrhage control, and shock treatment.
- Critical monitoring and resuscitation equipment such as defibrillators, oxygen delivery systems, and IV access.
- Quick turnover and accessibility to facilitate high casualty throughput during mass casualty events.
- Integration with surgical and evacuation pathways, ensuring seamless transition to operating theatres or higher echelons of care.

These beds serve as the first stop for severely injured personnel.

#### Intensive Care Unit (ICU)

Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds are designed to deliver advanced life-support and continuous monitoring for critically injured or ill personnel. These beds serve as the backbone of forward-deployed critical care, enabling:

- Resuscitation and stabilization of casualties with multi-system trauma.
- Mechanical ventilation, invasive monitoring, and medication infusions.
- Postoperative care following damage-control surgery.
- Support for prolonged field care when evacuation is delayed.

ICU beds are equipped with portable monitors, ventilators, infusion pumps, and access to diagnostics like labs and imaging.

#### Holding (Hold)

Holding beds are designated for short-term patient care and observation, typically for those who are awaiting evacuation, recovering from minor procedures, or expected to return to duty soon. These beds serve as a transitional space between acute treatment zones (like ICU or OT) and final disposition‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs evacuation to higher care or reintegration into the force.

They‚Äôre often used for:

- Postoperative recovery after damage-control surgery.
- Monitoring stable patients who don‚Äôt require intensive care.
- Staging casualties for medical evacuation.
- Low-dependency care such as hydration, pain management, or wound dressing.

Holding beds help to maintain patient flow and prevent bottlenecks in critical care areas.

### üöë Transport Assets

#### Protected Mobility Vehicle Ambulance (PMV Ambulance)

The PMV Ambulance (Protected Mobility Vehicle ‚Äì Ambulance) is a blast-resistant, armored medical transport designed to safely evacuate casualties from combat zones. Based on the Bushmaster, it combines mobility, protection, and medical capability, allowing medics to deliver care en route while shielding patients from small arms fire, IEDs, and mines.

Its key features typically include:

- V-shaped hull for blast deflection
- Internal stretcher mounts and medical equipment
- Air conditioning and fire suppression systems
- Optional mounted weapon systems for self-defense

#### HX2 40M

The HX2 40M is a 4√ó4 tactical military truck developed by Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles (RMMV) as part of the HX2 series. Designed for high mobility and rugged performance, it serves as a versatile logistics platform for transporting troops, equipment, and supplies in demanding operational environments. In this simulation the HX2 40M is used for the transport of KIA and casualties that have DOW.

## ü§ï Casualties

<small>[Return to Top](#contents)</small>

Casualties are generated based on rates outlined in [[1]](#References) and refined with analysis provided in [[5]](#References) and supported by [[4]](#References), with the implementation outlined below.

Initially, WIA and KIA rates from US historical analysis of the Battle of Okinawa were used [[1]](#References), producing approximately 30 casualties per day for a force size of 3,750‚Äîyielding a casualty rate of ~0.8%. By comparison, Russia‚Äôs estimated 700‚Äì1,100 daily casualties from a committed force of 450,000‚Äì600,000 in Ukraine imply a lower casualty rate of ~0.2% [[7]](#References).

Given this discrepancy, a planning baseline was re-evaluated using historical data from the Falklands War, which suggests a casualty rate of ~0.37% [[1]](#References). This adjustment accounts for both the likely under-reporting in Russian casualty estimates‚Äîparticularly of non-critical wounded personnel‚Äîand over three years of varied combat intensity in Ukraine, with seasonal fluctuations in operational tempo (source TBD).

Based on this reasoning, a daily casualty rate of ~0.37% is considered a suitable estimate for operational planning.

### Casualty Generation

For simulation efficiency, arrival times for cases were pre-computed and then introduced deterministically to the simulation environment for processing. The function simulates the timing of casualty arrivals using a lognormal distribution to reflect daily variability, transformed into randomized, minute-level arrival times. Rather than sampling explicit arrival times, the function models continuous per-minute intensity and converts this to discrete arrival events using cumulative thresholds. The general process is outlined below.

#### 1. Lognormal Parameterisation

Converts daily mean and standard deviation into log-space parameters, preserving the shape of the empirical distribution.

Mean (log-space):

$$
\mu_{\log} = \ln\left(\frac{\mu^2}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \mu^2}}\right)
$$

Standard deviation (log-space):

$$
\sigma_{\log} = \sqrt{\ln\left(1 + \frac{\sigma^2}{\mu^2}\right)}
$$

Where:

- \mu = expected number of DNBI casualties per day
- \sigma = daily standard deviation

#### 2. Per-Minute Rate Sampling and Scaling

Draws lognormally distributed samples representing per-minute DNBI rates, capped at a specified threshold to prevent extreme outliers. The sample is scaled according to population size and temporal resolution (per minute per 1000 personnel).

For each simulation minute $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n_{\text{minutes}}\}$, the per-minute DNBI rate is computed as:

$$
r_i = \min\left(x_i, \text{cap}\right) \times \frac{P}{1000 \times 1440}
$$

Where:

- $x_i \sim \text{LogNormal}(\mu_{\log}, \sigma_{\log}^2)$
- $\mu_{\log} = \ln\left(\frac{\mu^2}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \mu^2}}\right)$
- $\sigma_{\log} = \sqrt{\ln\left(1 + \frac{\sigma^2}{\mu^2}\right)}$
- $\mu, \sigma$ = daily mean and standard deviation
- $\text{cap}$ = upper bound (e.g., 5) to prevent extreme values
- $P$ = population size (support or combat)
- $r_i$ = scaled and capped casualty rate for minute i

#### 3. Arrival Detection via Cumulative Sum

Accumulates per-minute rates and detects new arrivals based on when the cumulative total crosses each whole casualty threshold.

Let R = \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_N\} be the per-minute rates. Then the cumulative sum is:

$$
C_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i} r_j
$$

An arrival is triggered at time i if:

$$
\lfloor C_i \rfloor > \lfloor C_{i-1} \rfloor
$$

This captures each increment in the expected arrival count.

#### 4. Temporal Randomisation

Introduces sub-minute jitter to avoid clustering arrivals on discrete time ticks and returns a sorted list of event timestamps.

### Wounded In Action (WIA)

#### Combat Casualties

Combat WIA casualty generation has been based on Falklands combat troop WIA rates ([[1]](#References), table A.8 p32).

$$
\mu = 1.77, \quad \sigma = 3.56
$$

#### Support Casualties

Support casualties employ the same casualty generation outlined above (except using the support population estimate of 1250 instead of the combatt population of 2250). This is on the basis that most historical modelling of force casualties include support elements at or below division in division and below casualty estimation due to their integral nature to combat operations and close proximity to the Forward Edge of the Battle Area (FEBA) (see [[4]](#References) and [[5]](#References) p 2-4).

### Killed In Action (KIA)

#### Combat Casualties

Combat WIA casualty generation has been based on Falklands combat troop WIA rates ([[1]](#References), table A.8 p32).

$$
\mu = 0.68, \quad \sigma = 1.39
$$

#### Support Casualties

Similar to WIA, support casualty KIA employ the same casualty generation outlined above (except using the support population estimate of 1250 instead of the combatt population of 2250) (see [[4]](#References) and [[5]](#References) p 2-4).

### Disease and Non-Battle Injury (DNBI)

#### Combat Casualties

Combat DNBI casualty generation has been based on Vietnam combat troop DNBI rates ([[1]](#References), table A.5 p31).

$$
\mu = 2.04, \quad \sigma = 1.89
$$

#### Support Casualties

Support DNBI casualty generation has been based on Okinawa support troop DNBI rates ([[1]](#References), table A.2 p29).

$$
\mu = 0.94, \sigma = 0.56
$$

#### DNBI Sub-Categorisation

DNBI cases were further sub-categorised as either NBI or disease/battle fatigue with 17% of DNBI cases being allocated as NBI and the remainder disease or battle fatigue (per [[1]](#References), pp 22-23).

## Casualty Priorities

<small>[Return to Top](#contents)</small>

The following casualty priority rates were used with the rates requiring surgery (informed by [[2]](#References)):

- **Priority 1**. 65% of casualties with 90% requiring surgery.

- **Priority 2**. 20% of casualties with 80% requiring surgery.

- **Priority 3**. 15% of casualties with:
  
  - 40% of DNBI requiring surgery.
  
  - 60% of other priority 3 casualties requiring surgery. 

## Return to Duty

<small>[Return to Top](#contents)</small>

- Priority 3 are returned to duty from R1. Priority 1 and 2 that do not require surgery are RTF post recovery from emergency treatment at r2b.

- Per [[3]](#References), of those admitted to MTFs, the distribution for return to duty was 42.1 percent in Republic of Vietnam, 7.6 percent in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and 33.4 percent in the CONUS.

## Died of Wounds

<small>[Return to Top](#contents)</small>

5% of Priority 1 and 2.5% of P2 at R1, 1% of arrivals at R2B, 1% of arrivals ar R2E Heavy

## Simulation Design

<small>[Return to Top](#contents)</small>

### üîßSimulation Environment Setup

The simulation models casualty handling across echelons of care in a battlefield environment, structured around modular trajectories and dynamic resource availability. It operates within a discrete-event simulation framework using `simmer`, and is driven by probabilistic rates, conditional branching, and resource interactions across Role 1 (R1), Role 2 Basic (R2B), and Role 2 Enhanced Heavy (R2E) facilities.

The simulation was designed around the general functions of each role of health element as outlined in the diagram below. Where roles overlap they are able to provide the same functions to varying degree.

The simulation heavily uses triangular distributions to model the duration of activities undertaken in the model (treatment, transport and other handling tasks). A triangular distributions was employed as they are generally used when the underlying distribution is unknown, but a minimal value, some maximal value, and a most likely value are available [[8]](#References). This approach is similar to other applications of DES in clinical settings, as shown in [[9]](#References).

### Core Trajectory

The casualty processing trajectory at R1 care establishes a dynamic and doctrinally aligned framework for routing battlefield casualties based on classification‚Äîwounded in action (WIA), disease/non-battle injury (DNBI), or killed in action (KIA). Each casualty is initialized with key attributes: assignment to a R1 team (via random selection), triage priority for WIA/DNBI based on weighted probabilities (priority 1‚Äì3) per [\[2\]](#References), NBI status flagged with a ``17%`` probability [\[1\]](#References), and a probabilistic determination of surgical need based on casualty type and severity [\[2\]](#References). WIA and DNBI casualties are determined if they have died-of-wounds (DOW) with probabilistic allocation of DOW for Priority 1 and Priority 2 cases‚Äî``5%`` DOW chance for Priority 1 and ``2.5%`` for Priority 2 casualties (estimate based on reporting in [\[17\]](#References)). Those flagged as DOW are reclassified and routed through KIA processing. 

Survivors are dispositioned based on urgency: evacuation decisions for Priority 1 and Priority 2 cases result in approximately ``95%`` of Priority 1 and ``90%`` of Priority 2 casualties advancing (based on estimates of casualty surgical requirement from [\[2\]](#References)) to R2B, or bypassing to R2E if R2B teams are unavailable. Lower-priority or DNBI casualties not meeting evacuation criteria are retained for local recovery at the R1, with a recovery duration modeled using triangular distribution with ``min = 0.5``, ``max = 5``, and ``mode = 2`` (days), based on field estimates of minor injury convalescence. WIA and DNBI casualties receiving immediate treatment at R1 are assigned a treatment duration drawn from a triangular distribution with ``min = 10``, ``max = 30``, and ``mode = 20`` (minutes) per [\[18\]](#References). KIA casualties bypass clinical treatment and are processed and transported, each having a processing duration with a triangular distribution: ``min = 15``, ``max = 45``, and ``mode = 30`` (minutes).

### R2B Trajectory

Casualties routed to the R2B undergo surgical care, stabilization, and further dispositioning. Casualties are initially assigned a holding bed, until they can be transferred to a resuscitation bed.

Similar to the R1, where DOW occurs (~1% of arrivals at the R2B, again based on [[17]](#References)), casualties undergo a short treatment and are transported to the mortuary. Treatment and transport both use a duration with a triangular distribution: `min = 15`, `max = 45`, and `mode = 30` (minutes).

Resuscitation is modeled using a triangular distribution with ``min = 25``, ``max = 70``, and ``mode = 45`` (min). This distribution was developed based on estimates as there were no clear durations that could be identified in literature for the duration to be used for the resuscitation/emergency phase of treatment in R2 facilities. Instead, the likely/anticipated tasks required to be undertaken in this phase were collated with task duration estimates collated to produce estimates for use in the simulation (demonstrated in the table below). The durations were developed recognising the need for all activities to be completed within 90 min as indicated by [[10]](#References).

| Long Resuscitation       |           |            |           |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Step                     | Min (min) | Mode (min) | Max (min) |
| Hemorrhage Control       | 2         | 5          | 10        |
| IV/IO Access             | 2         | 5          | 10        |
| TXA Administration       | 10        | 10         | 15        |
| Fluid Resuscitation      | 5         | 10         | 20        |
| Airway/Breathing Support | 3         | 5          | 10        |
| TBI Monitoring & Warming | 2         | 5          | 10        |
| Documentation/Prep       | 2         | 3          | 5         |
| **TOTAL**                | 25        | 45         | 70        |

Once resuscitation/emergency treatment has been completed, casualties not requiring surgery are transferred to a holding bed for recovery. Recovery follows a triangular distribution with ``min = 0.5``, ``max = 10``, and ``mode = 5`` (days).

Next, surgical candidacy is assessed based on operating theatre (OT) bed availability. If capacity permits, patients requiring surgery are transferred to an operating theatre for damage control (DAMCON) surgery. The DAMCON surgery treatment duration is modeled using a triangular distribution with ``min = 41``, ``max = 210``, and ``mode = 95`` (minutes). Due to the variability of potential requirements for surgery it was difficult to identify reliable durations for surgery time. This distribution was developed based on the interpretation of several meta studies ([[11]](#References), [[12]](#References) and [[13]](#References)). Where there is not OT capacity, casualties are evacuated to the R2E for handling. 

Casualties requiring further care (surgery following the DCS model described in [[11]](#References) and [[19]](#References)) are evacuated to the R2E. The duration for evacuation to the R2E follows a triangular distribution with ``min = 15``, ``max = 45``, and ``mode = 30``. Where evacuation resources are not available, the patient is transferred to the ICU until evacuation resources are available to facilitate transfer.

### R2E Heavy Trajectory

The R2E facility serves as a critical node for advanced casualty management, including resuscitation, surgery, intensive care, holding and pathways to strategic evacuation. 

Upon arrival, casualties are triaged, those identified as DOW (~1%, based on [[17]](#References)) are transferred for mortuary handling. Surviving casualties are allocated to an initial holding bed until a resuscitation bay is available, where they undergo a resuscitation phase. Where previous resuscitation has not been completed (at the R2B) a long duration resuscitation is completed, otherwise a short resuscitation is completed. The R2E long duration resuscitation follows the triangular distribution estimated for R2B resuscitations (`min = 25`, `max = 70`, and `mode = 45` (min)). The short duration resuscitation is modelled based on task estimate durations. These times are outlined in the table below. The duration uses a triangular distribution with ``min = 13``, ``max = 55``, and ``mode = 28``.

| Short Reuscitation       |           |            |           |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Step                     | Min (min) | Mode (min) | Max (min) |
| Hemorrhage Control       | 2         | 5          | 10        |
| IV/IO Access             | 2         | 5          | 10        |
| Fluid Resuscitation      | 5         | 10         | 20        |
| TBI Monitoring & Warming | 2         | 5          | 10        |
| Documentation/Prep       | 2         | 3          | 5         |
| **TOTAL**                | 13        | 28         | 55        |

On completion of resuscitation, surgical candidacy is then assessed: if the casualty is flagged for damage control surgery and operating theatre resources are available, procedures follow the same triangular distribution for DAMCON surgeries at the R2B (``min =41``, ``max = 210``, and ``mode = 95``), derived from meta-analyses and other academic studies ([[11]](#References), [[12]](#References), and [[13]](#References)). 

Post-operative care involves admission to the ICU, where durations vary by surgical phase: the first ICU period ranges from ``min = 770`` to ``max = 2160`` minutes (``mode =  1440``) based on descriptions of post- DCS-I stabilization requirements (described as 24-36 h in most DCS research [[11]](#References), [[14]](#References), [[15]](#References), [[16]](#References)), while the secondary ICU phase (following second surgery) ranges from ``min = 30`` to ``mode = 90``, with ``mode = 60`` (min) to allow for post surgery monitoring and stabilisation prior to transfer to holding. Casualties who arrive at the R2E requiring surgery, but not having received any prior to arrival are queued to complete a second round of surgery after ICU time. 

After completing surgery and ICU monitoring, patients are either transferred to holding for recovery or undertake strategic evacuation. ~10% of casualties undertake recovery at the R2E following a triangular distribution for recovery time with ``min = 1``, ``max = 21``, and ``mode = 9`` (days) this distribution was selected on the basis that casualties with shorter recovery times and a likelihood for capacity to return to duty following recovery would be retained in theatre. The remaining ~90% are transferred for strategy evacuation. Based on [[3]](#References) Vietnam data that indicated 31% return to duty with 42% in theatre providing about 13% recovery in theatre at R2E

There is insufficient OT bed / surgical capability availability compared to other resource types in the architecture.

1. May be an opportunity to either (a) right-size holding bed quantity, or (b) expand the in-theatre recovery beyond 10% supporting faster return to duty and relieving pressure at higher care facilities.

[Sankey flow diagram](%5Bplotly-logomark%5D(https://natosys.github.io/Battlefield-Casualty-Handling/sankey.html)), gives a visual diagram of the flow of casualties between echelons of health care.

## Multi-Run Analysis

1. If historical models of casualty generation remain accurate for LSCO, future deployable health system must be able to handle X number of casualties per day.

2. 

---

## Further Development

1. Add usage of transport resources for return journey (dead-heading).

2. Pulse strategic medical evacuation to simuate temporal availability of the resource.

3. General model refinement through expert consultation.
